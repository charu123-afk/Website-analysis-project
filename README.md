# website analysis project
**Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing website performance data to understand user behavior, traffic sources, and engagement patterns. The analysis was performed using Python libraries to clean, process, and visualize data, enabling data-driven insights for improving website performance and marketing strategy.

**Dataset**

Website traffic export data (similar to Google Analytics)
Key metrics include:
Users
Sessions
Engaged Sessions
Engagement Rate
Events per Session
Average Engagement Time
Channel Group (Direct, Organic Social, etc.)
Date and Hour-level data

**Tools & Technologies Used**

**Python**

NumPy – numerical calculations and metric handling
Pandas – data cleaning, transformation, null value handling, and aggregation
Matplotlib – basic visualizations and trend analysis
Seaborn – advanced and attractive statistical visualizations
Jupyter Notebook – interactive analysis and documentation

**Key Analysis Performed**

Cleaned raw website export data by handling null values and correcting column structures
Analyzed traffic distribution across different channel groups
Performed time-based analysis (hourly/date-level trends)
Compared user engagement metrics across traffic sources

**Visualized:**

Sessions by channel group
Engagement rate trends
Event counts and average engagement time
Traffic patterns using bar charts, line charts, and heatmaps

**Insights & Outcomes**

Identified high-performing traffic channels based on engagement metrics
Observed peak traffic hours and user activity patterns
Highlighted channels with strong user retention and interaction
Provided actionable insights for marketing optimization and website performance improvement
